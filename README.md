## How it works
### Shift-click a chest.
Its dead simple. 
Shift-right click on a chest, and all items from your inventory that are already present in the chest will be moved into the chest. 
You do not have to open the chest, nor your inventory.
This makes it straightforward and efficient to unload your inventory after a mining session or any other kind of expedition. 
Just click on every chest in your storage room, and your inventory will be clutter-free in no time.

### Individual Player Preferences
ChestRestack also gives every player the option to adjust their individual preferences to tailor the functionality to suit their needs.
These preferences include the following:
- Should the chest be sorted after restacking?
- Should items from the hotbar be moved?
- Should tools and weapons be moved?
- Should armor be moved?
- Should arrows and rockets be moved?
- Should shift-right or shift-left click trigger the functionality?
- Or should the feature be disabled entirely?
